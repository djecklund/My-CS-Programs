<h1>My C# Programs</h1>
<p>This repository contains the C# Programs I've built.</p>
<p><b>Programs in this repository:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li><b>CollatzConjecture</b> - This program starts with a number > 1 given by the user. The program then finds the number of steps it takes to reach 1 using the following process: If the number is even, divide it by 2. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 then add 1. This was a challenge I found online and decided to recreate.</li>
  <li><b>FizzBuzzProgram</b> - This is a program idea I found online that I thought sounded cool, so I decided to build it. The program goes like this: Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. For each multiple of 3, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For each multiple of 5, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.</li>
</ol>
